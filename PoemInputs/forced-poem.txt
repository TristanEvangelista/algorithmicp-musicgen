I lost my dog
My grandmother dies
I am crying my heart out
My dog is dying

I got promoted in my job
The flower is blooming
But now I am truly blessed
Because good things happened

The bomb exploded and I retreated to my bunker
The killers and murderers came back
The cancer has returned
There are a lot of cobra coming
